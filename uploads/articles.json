      "content": "I often receive questions like which is a first programming language to learn?, Is Java a good programming language to start with?, how good Java is as a first programming language, which is the best programming language for beginners, or shall I start with Java or Python?.\r\nWell, the answer to all these questions is, Java is one of the most popular programming languages, and there are a lot of reasons to learn Java, starting with Job opportunities to leveraging community support.\r\nBut, in the context of beginning programming or choosing Java as the first language, my most significant reason is that it’s simpler to learn.\r\nPeople may argue that Python is even simpler and doesn’t even require to compile but I personally found Java much easier to read and understand.\r\nThe last generation of programmers started learning to program using languages like BASIC and then grew up learning C and C++ with Java as their second or third programming language.\r\nOne reason for this could be that C and C++ were more prevalent in those days than Java, the other most curriculum was designed to teach C and C++, and there was no Python those days, at least not in our college.\r\nThis is true, *often we don’t make a choice, and we learn as part of the programming curriculum at school and colleges. In my time, C was the first programming language in our engineering college, and then we learned C++, VB, VC++, and finally Java.\r\nNow I am saying Java more straightforward and easy to learn, but I still remember saying it was more complicated than C++ because I had to type System.out.println() instead of simpler cout to print something on the screen, but that was just a momentary feeling.\r\nWhen I started writing and maintaining bigger programs, I found Java much more readable, and you can think about what code is doing. Debugging and finding a problem was also much more comfortable in Java than compared to C++ or C.\r\nBy the way, I learn professional programming, or you say real coding only on my first job, and that was when I seriously started learning Java.\r\nIs Java a Good Programming Langauge to Start With?\r\nHere are my couple of reasons, why I think Java is the right programming language to start learning to code:\r\n\r\n1. Simple\r\nJava is simpler, the syntax is much more readable than C, C++ or any other language.\r\n2. Object-Oriented Programming\r\nJava is good to learn Object-Oriented programming, but not so good for procedural one, prefer C there. The OOP or Object Oriented programming is a useful skill because it handles the complexity of a real-world application quite well. It’s easier to think in terms of class and objects.\r\n3. Rich API and third-party libraries\r\nJava has a rich API, and you can do a lot more with Java including graphics, sound and most likely writing small games like Tic Tac Toe, Tetris, etc.\r\nNot that you cannot do that with other languages, you often need to download and install different modules and library, which is a tough job for a starter. When you install Java, most of these feature comes as part of the installation only.\r\n4. Community Support\r\nJava has strong community support, no matter what kind of questions, doubt, or issue you have, Google can find answers for you. If not Google, then StackOverflow, Java forums, and a lot of other communities are there to help you out.\r\nThis is really the single biggest reason I suggest beginners learn to code using Java because when you are starting to learn to program you will face many different kinds of issues to understand for both programming fundamentals and Java.\r\nBecause there are millions of Java developers around and a big community is there to support, most likely you will find answers quickly without getting frustrated and disappointed.\r\n5. Strongly typed language\r\nJava is a strongly typed language, which catches many newbie mistakes. Also valid, to a lesser extent, for static typing. This is another reason I suggest beginners learn Java first then Python because Python is a dynamic typing language, you don’t need to define types which make learning confusing a bit.\r\n6. Built-in Garbage Collector\r\nJava comes with an in-built Garbage collection, which is a big plus for a complete beginner. Dealing with memory management is a big thing at the start of learning programming.\r\nThese are some of the reasons why I think beginners should learn Java first than any other language. I may be biased because I am a Java programmer, but I also know Python, and I have also done professional programming in C and C++. From that experience, I can say that Java is undoubtedly one of the best programming languages for beginners.\r\nIf you have already made up your mind to learn Java, then you can join The Complete Java Masterclass to start your journey into the beautiful world of Java. This is one of the best courses to learn Java for beginners. It’s comprehensive but at the same time hands-on and suitable for beginners.\r\n\r\nIs Java Enough for a Successful Programming Career?\r\nNow the question is the difference, It’s NOT. As a programmer, you must know a lot of things, like data structures, algorithms, memory management, object-oriented programming, scripting, etc. and different language teaches you a different thing.\r\nOnce you are comfortable with Java, you can move to other useful programming languages like Scala, JavaScript, or also go towards scripting languages, like Python, which doesn’t need to be compiled.\r\nTo be successful in a programming career, you need to keep learning and evolving, that’s the biggest challenge of this field. If you happen to love programming and learn new technologies and languages, then this is the right field for you.\r\nAnother important thing for a successful programmer is to develop debugging skills, which is a reasoning based skill. If you want to become a better Java developer, you can also see my recent post about 10 tips to become a better Java developer in 2021.\r\n\r\nIf you are good with reasoning and can make a conclusion based upon limited available information, then it will be easy for you to troubleshoot issues and find problems.\r\nHaving a good knowledge of IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans, or IntelliJIDEA will also help you with your coding and debugging journey, Java is blessed with a really excellent tool.\r\nThat’s all on this folks. In my opinion, Java is definitely an excellent language to start programming with, because it’s simpler than many others and focuses truly on programming rather than managing systems, like memory management.\r\nIf you are convinced to start learning to code with Java than pick up a copy of Head First Java or join The Complete Java Masterclass and start your journey of programming with one of the best programming languages, Java.\r\nIn short, You can definitely choose Java as your first programming language and once you are comfortable, try to learn a couple of more, like JavaScript or Python.\r\nMore Resources\r\nJava Tutorial for Complete Beginners (FREE)\r\nData Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java\r\nJava Fundamentals: The Java Language\r\nJava Basics for Beginners (FREE Course)\r\nPractice Java by Building Projects (FREE Course)\r\n10 Free Java Courses for Beginners and Intermediate developers\r\n10 Things Java Developer should learn in 2019\r\n21 Websites to Learn Coding for FREE\r\nThanks for reading this article so far.

      "content": "Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:\nObject Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.\nPlatform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.\nSimple − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.\nSecure − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.\nArchitecture-neutral − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.\nPortable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.\nRobust − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking."

      "content": "A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.\r\n\r\nTypically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.\r\n\r\nAll classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used.\r\n\r\nSyntax\r\nFollowing is the syntax of a constructor −\r\n\r\nclass ClassName {\r\n   ClassName() {\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nJava allows two types of constructors namely −\r\n\r\nNo argument Constructors\r\nParameterized Constructors\r\nNo argument Constructors\r\nAs the name specifies the no argument constructors of Java does not accept any parameters instead, using these constructors the instance variables of a method will be initialized with fixed values for all objects.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nPublic class MyClass {\r\n   Int num;\r\n   MyClass() {\r\n      num = 100;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nYou would call constructor to initialize objects as follows\r\n\r\npublic class ConsDemo {\r\n   public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n      MyClass t1 = new MyClass();\r\n      MyClass t2 = new MyClass();\r\n      System.out.println(t1.num + \" \" + t2.num);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nThis would produce the following result\r\n\r\n100 100\r\nParameterized Constructors\r\nMost often, you will need a constructor that accepts one or more parameters. Parameters are added to a constructor in the same way that they are added to a method, just declare them inside the parentheses after the constructor's name.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nHere is a simple example that uses a constructor −\r\n\r\n// A simple constructor.\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n   int x;\r\n   \r\n   // Following is the constructor\r\n   MyClass(int i ) {\r\n      x = i;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nYou would call constructor to initialize objects as follows −\r\n\r\npublic class ConsDemo {\r\n   public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n      MyClass t1 = new MyClass( 10 );\r\n      MyClass t2 = new MyClass( 20 );\r\n      System.out.println(t1.x + \" \" + t2.x);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nThis would produce the following result −"

      "content": "\r\nVariables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory.\r\n\r\nBased on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables.\r\n\r\nThere are two data types available in Java −\r\n\r\nPrimitive Data Types\r\nReference/Object Data Types\r\nPrimitive Data Types\r\nThere are eight primitive datatypes supported by Java. Primitive datatypes are predefined by the language and named by a keyword. Let us now look into the eight primitive data types in detail.\r\n\r\nbyte\r\n\r\nByte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer\r\n\r\nMinimum value is -128 (-2^7)\r\n\r\nMaximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)\r\n\r\nDefault value is 0\r\n\r\nByte data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in place of integers, since a byte is four times smaller than an integer.\r\n\r\nExample: byte a = 100, byte b = -50\r\n\r\nshort\r\n\r\nShort data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer\r\n\r\nMinimum value is -32,768 (-2^15)\r\n\r\nMaximum value is 32,767 (inclusive) (2^15 -1)\r\n\r\nShort data type can also be used to save memory as byte data type. A short is 2 times smaller than an integer\r\n\r\nDefault value is 0.\r\n\r\nExample: short s = 10000, short r = -20000\r\n\r\nint\r\n\r\nInt data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.\r\n\r\nMinimum value is - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31)\r\n\r\nMaximum value is 2,147,483,647(inclusive) (2^31 -1)\r\n\r\nInteger is generally used as the default data type for integral values unless there is a concern about memory.\r\n\r\nThe default value is 0\r\n\r\nExample: int a = 100000, int b = -200000\r\n\r\nlong\r\n\r\nLong data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer\r\nMinimum value is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63)\r\nMaximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive)(2^63 -1)\r\nThis type is used when a wider range than int is needed\r\nDefault value is 0L\r\nExample: long a = 100000L, long b = -200000L\r\nfloat\r\n\r\nFloat data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point\r\n\r\nFloat is mainly used to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers\r\n\r\nDefault value is 0.0f\r\n\r\nFloat data type is never used for precise values such as currency\r\n\r\nExample: float f1 = 234.5f\r\n\r\ndouble\r\n\r\ndouble data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point\r\n\r\nThis data type is generally used as the default data type for decimal values, generally the default choice\r\n\r\nDouble data type should never be used for precise values such as currency\r\n\r\nDefault value is 0.0d\r\n\r\nExample: double d1 = 123.4\r\n\r\nboolean\r\n\r\nboolean data type represents one bit of information\r\nThere are only two possible values: true and false\r\nThis data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions\r\nDefault value is false\r\nExample: boolean one = true\r\nchar\r\n\r\nchar data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character\r\nMinimum value is '\\u0000' (or 0)\r\nMaximum value is '\\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)\r\nChar data type is used to store any character\r\nExample: char letterA = 'A'\r\nReference Datatypes\r\nReference variables are created using defined constructors of the classes. They are used to access objects. These variables are declared to be of a specific type that cannot be changed. For example, Employee, Puppy, etc.\r\n\r\nClass objects and various type of array variables come under reference datatype.\r\n\r\nDefault value of any reference variable is null.\r\n\r\nA reference variable can be used to refer any object of the declared type or any compatible type.\r\n\r\nExample: Animal animal = new Animal(\"giraffe\");\r\n\r\nJava Literals\r\nA literal is a source code representation of a fixed value. They are represented directly in the code without any computation.\r\n\r\nLiterals can be assigned to any primitive type variable. For example −\r\n\r\nbyte a = 68;\r\nchar a = 'A';\r\nbyte, int, long, and short can be expressed in decimal(base 10), hexadecimal(base 16) or octal(base 8) number systems as well.\r\n\r\nPrefix 0 is used to indicate octal, and prefix 0x indicates hexadecimal when using these number systems for literals. For example −\r\n\r\nint decimal = 100;\r\nint octal = 0144;\r\nint hexa =  0x64;\r\nString literals in Java are specified like they are in most other languages by enclosing a sequence of characters between a pair of double quotes. Examples of string literals are −\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n\"Hello World\"\r\n\"two\\nlines\"\r\n\"\\\"This is in quotes\\\"\"\r\nString and char types of literals can contain any Unicode characters. For example −\r\n\r\nchar a = '\\u0001';\r\nString a = \"\\u0001\";\r\nJava language supports few special escape sequences for String and char literals as well. They are −\r\n\r\nNotation\tCharacter represented\r\n\\n\tNewline (0x0a)\r\n\\r\tCarriage return (0x0d)\r\n\\f\tFormfeed (0x0c)\r\n\\b\tBackspace (0x08)\r\n\\s\tSpace (0x20)\r\n\\t\ttab\r\n\\\"\tDouble quote\r\n\\'\tSingle quote\r\n\\\\\tbackslash\r\n\\ddd\tOctal character (ddd)\r\n\\uxxxx\tHexadecimal UNICODE character (xxxx)\r\n"

We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups −\r\n\r\nArithmetic Operators\r\nRelational Operators\r\nBitwise Operators\r\nLogical Operators\r\nAssignment Operators\r\nMisc Operators\r\nThe Arithmetic Operators\r\nArithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra.

Assume if a = 60 and b = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows −\r\n\r\na = 0011 1100\r\n\r\nb = 0000 1101\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\na&b = 0000 1100\r\n\r\na|b = 0011 1101\r\n\r\na^b = 0011 0001\r\n\r\n~a  = 1100 0011\r\n\r\nThe following table lists the bitwise operators −\r\n\r\nAssume integer variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13 then −\r\n\r\nShow Examples\r\n\r\nOperator\tDescription\tExample\r\n& (bitwise and)\tBinary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.\t(A & B) will give 12 which is 0000 1100\r\n| (bitwise or)\tBinary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.\t(A | B) will give 61 which is 0011 1101\r\n^ (bitwise XOR)\tBinary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.\t(A ^ B) will give 49 which is 0011 0001\r\n~ (bitwise compliment)\tBinary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.\t(~A ) will give -61 which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.\r\n<< (left shift)\tBinary Left Shift Operator.

Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.\tC = A + B will assign value of A + B into C\r\n+=\tAdd AND assignment operator. It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand.\tC += A is equivalent to C = C + A\r\n-=\tSubtract AND assignment operator. It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand.\tC -= A is equivalent to C = C – A\r\n*=\tMultiply AND assignment operator. It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand.\tC *= A is equivalent to C = C * A\r\n/=\tDivide AND assignment operator. It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand.\tC /= A is equivalent to C = C / A\r\n%=\tModulus AND assignment operator. It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand.\tC %= A is equivalent to C = C % A\r\n<<=\tLeft shift AND assignment operator.\tC <<= 2 is same as C = C << 2\r\n>>=\tRight shift AND assignment operator.\tC >>= 2 is same as C = C >> 2\r\n&=\tBitwise AND assignment operator.\tC &= 2 is same as C = C & 2\r\n^=\tbitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator.\tC ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2\r\n|=\tbitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator.\tC |= 2 is same as C = C | 2\r\nMiscellaneous Operators\r\nThere are few other operators supported by Java Language.\r\n\r\nConditional Operator ( ? : )\r\n\r\nConditional operator is also known as the ternary operator. This operator consists of three operands and is used to evaluate Boolean expressions. The goal of the operator is to decide, which value should be assigned to the variable. The operator is written as −\r\n\r\nvariable x = (expression) ? value if true : value if false\r\nFollowing is an example −\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nLive Demo\r\npublic class Test {\r\n\r\n   public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n      int a, b;\r\n      a = 10;\r\n      b = (a == 1) ? 20: 30;\r\n      System.out.println( \"Value of b is : \" +  b );\r\n\r\n      b = (a == 10) ? 20: 30;\r\n      System.out.println( \"Value of b is : \" + b );\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nThis will produce the following result −\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n\r\nValue of b is : 30\r\nValue of b is : 20\r\ninstanceof Operator\r\n\r\nThis operator is used only for object reference variables. The operator checks whether the object is of a particular type (class type or interface type). instanceof operator is written as −\r\n\r\n( Object reference variable ) instanceof  (class/interface type)\r\nIf the object referred by the variable on the left side of the operator passes the IS-A check for the class/interface type on the right side, then the result will be true. Following is an example −\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nLive Demo\r\npublic class Test {\r\n\r\n   public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n\r\n      String name = \"James\";\r\n\r\n      // following will return true since name is type of String\r\n      boolean result = name instanceof String;\r\n      System.out.println( result );\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nThis will produce the following result −\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n\r\ntrue\r\nThis operator will still return true, if the object being compared is the assignment compatible with the type on the right. Following is one more example −\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nLive Demo\r\nclass Vehicle {}\r\n\r\npublic class Car extends Vehicle {\r\n\r\n   public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n\r\n      Vehicle a = new Car();\r\n      boolean result =  a instanceof Car;\r\n      System.out.println( result );\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nThis will produce the following result −\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n\r\ntrue\r\nPrecedence of Java Operators\r\nOperator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression.

The String class has 11 constructors that allow you to provide the initial value of the string using different sources, such as an array of characters.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nLive Demo\r\npublic class StringDemo {\r\n\r\n   public static void main(String args[]) {\r\n      char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };\r\n      String helloString = new String(helloArray);  \r\n      System.out.println( helloString );\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nThis will produce the following result −\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n\r\nhello.\r\nNote − The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, then you should use String Buffer & String Builder Classes.\r\n\r\nString Length\r\nMethods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods. One accessor method that you can use with strings is the length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object.\r\n\r\nThe following program is an example of length(), method String class.\r\n\r\nExample"

As a platform, Angular includes:\\nA component-based framework for building scalable web applicationsA collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and moreA suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code\\nWith Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators."

Each component consists of:\r\n\r\nAn HTML template that declares what renders on the page\r\nA Typescript class that defines behavior\r\nA CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template\r\nOptionally, CSS styles applied to the template\r\nThis topic describes how to create and configure an Angular component.\r\n\r\nTo view or download the example code used in this topic, see the live example / download example.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\nTo create a component, verify that you have met the following prerequisites:\r\n\r\nInstall the Angular CLI.\r\nCreate an Angular workspace with initial application. If you don't have a project, create one using ng new <project-name>, where <project-name> is the name of your Angular application.\r\nCreating a component\r\nThe best way to create a component is with the Angular CLI. You can also create a component manually.\r\n\r\nCreating a component using the Angular CLI\r\nTo create a component using the Angular CLI:\r\n\r\nFrom a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing your application.\r\nRun the ng generate component <component-name> command, where <component-name> is the name of your new component.\r\nBy default, this command creates the following:\r\n\r\nA folder named after the component\r\nA component file, <component-name>.component.ts\r\nA template file, <component-name>.component.html\r\nA CSS file, <component-name>.component.css\r\nA testing specification file, <component-name>.component.spec.ts\r\nWhere <component-name> is the name of your component.\r\n\r\nYou can change how ng generate component creates new components. For more information, see ng generate component in the Angular CLI documentation.\r\n\r\nCreating a component manually\r\nAlthough the Angular CLI is the best way to create an Angular component, you can also create a component manually. This section describes how to create the core component file within an existing Angular project.\r\n\r\nTo create a new component manually:\r\n\r\nNavigate to your Angular project directory.\r\nCreate a new file, <component-name>.component.ts."

But she says it’s a good way of making someone you fancy really know how you feel.\r\n\r\nMake sure you’re in a one-on-one conversation with the person, not a group setting – you want to be sure they’ll be looking at you the whole time you do it.\r\n\r\nHere’s how you actually do the psychology love eye trick that’s all over TikTok:\r\nIt’s very easy, and just requires three simple steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
